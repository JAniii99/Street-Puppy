		  <h2><font color="darkblue">1. Use our website’s search to find pets for adoption!</font></h2>
		
		<b>Street puppy is a organization where shelters, rescues, and private owners list their pets for adoption. 
		We don’t have the pets ourselves!
		Type in your zip code and select the type of pet you want, then click the search button.
		You will see photos of matching pets. Click on a pet’s photo to see that pet’s information and Adoption Process.
		<br>
		Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for? Wait a second, did we just
		say personality, and not breed? Yes, that is right. Finding the ideal pet for yourself or family
		should start with an understanding of the ideal pet personality. Consider this, do you need a dog
		that is low key and good with kids, or are you looking for an energetic pal who is into trail running?
		<br>
		The dog rescues that post hundreds of local pets near you are experts at
		matching you with a dog who will love the life you can provide. This is why so many people
		are realizing focusing on dog adoption from a rescue is the ideal pet search process. Simply tell us what you are looking
		for and we will email you when that perfect pet is available! So even if you've made the
		commitment to adopt a puppy, we will email you immediately when we know of a
		local little furry fellow who is in need of a new home!</b>

		  <h2><font color="darkblue">2. Advices for how to adopt pets?</font></h2>
		
		<b>If you’ve never adopted a pet before, you may be wondering, how does the process work? How long does it
		take? How much does it cost? The information below will help give you an overview of how it works to adopt a
		pet from Shelters and Rescues, or Rehome: Cared for by Private Owner pet listings. Each is different, and it
		helps to understand what to expect, so you can have a better overall pet adoption experience.</b>
		<br><br>
		  <font color="darkblue"><b>Adopting from a Shelter</b></font>
		<br><br>
		<b>Shelters include public shelters like the city and county animal shelters, animal control, police and health
		departments, dog wardens, and are often called the pound. There are also private shelters that might use the
		words “humane society” or “SPCA” in their name. They are all separate, independently run organizations or
		government offices. Just because shelters have similar names does not mean they are connected — just like 
		different banks might have the word “bank” in their name.</b>
		<br><br>
		  <font color="darkblue"><b>Adopting from a Rescue</b></font>
		<br><br> 
		<b>Rescues most often have their pets in foster homes or private boarding facilities, and are run by volunteers. They
		may have adoption events at pet stores on the weekends. If a pet you see on our site says that pet is at
		a Rescue, be sure to read the pet description and the Adoption Process under that, and follow each rescue’s
		instructions. Some prefer you email them firstsome prefer you fill out their application before asking about a pet, 
		so they can answer your questions more knowledgeably.</b>
